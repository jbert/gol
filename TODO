DONE - add int type so we can write simple test cases

DONE - add -ve integers and tests

DONE - work out where we should eval let binding bodies
	- needs to be eval-time so outer bindings work:
		(let ((+ *))
			(let ((x (+ 1 2)))
				x))

DONE - add '+' in default env
	- add NodeApplicable
	- no type info (or arity)
	- just helper funcs

- reorg code
	- types + methods all in their own file

DONE - lambda
	- has to carry env with it for eval
		- eval in env at the time
		- (let ((a 1))
			(let ((f (lambda (x) (+ a x))))
				(let ((a 2))
					(f 3))))

DONE - check application to redex
	- (+ (+ 1 2) (+ 2 3))
	- (let ((f (lambda (x) (+ 1 x))))
		(f (+ 1 2)))

DONE - progn

DONE - add implicit progn to let+lambda

- variable bindings
	- define
		- top level?
		- internal define?
		- what are the rules for scheme?
	- syntactic sugar for functions

- call into go code?
	- reserve '.' anywhere in identifier
	(.println "hello, world")
	(fmt.Printf "hello, world\n")
	- done by writing out golang src!?
		- instead of eval

- have decorate set up NodeError
	- e.g. decorateLet
	- reference the original node
	- which can in turn reference file, line and column

- add real test cases as xxx_test
	- explore go tap?

- test failed let decorate
	- check file/line/pos info

DONE - add let special form

- add progn special form
	- implicit progn in let
		- so add one in decorate if needed

- work out what an applicable is so we can define addInt (maybe generic addNum?)

- add lambda to define our own applicables

- add some i/o applicable primitives
