DONE - add int type so we can write simple test cases

DONE - add -ve integers and tests

- have decorate set up NodeError
	- e.g. decorateLet
	- reference the original node
	- which can in turn reference file, line and column

- add let special form

- add progn special form
	- implicit progn in let
		- so add one in decorate if needed

- work out what an applicable is so we can define addInt (maybe generic addNum?)

- add lambda to define our own applicables

- add some i/o applicable primitives
