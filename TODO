- add int type so we can write simple test cases

- add -ve integers and tests

- add some tests for float
	- 1.1 should print as 1.1, not 1.1000000
	- post-process sprintf output !?
	- rationals?

- add let special form

- work out what an applicable is so we can define addInt (maybe generic addNum?)

- add lambda to define our own applicables

- add some i/o applicable primitives
