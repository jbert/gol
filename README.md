GOL
===

A bit of fun parsing s-expressions into a syntax tree in golang, with an interpreter.

May end up trying to compile-to-golang, in order to work with 'go generate'.

See 'TODO' for current direction.

OK. That was fun. Basic compilation-to-go working with some minor type
inference. Don't fancy trying to get (quasi-)quoting working with compilation
though. And it's too ugly to live.
